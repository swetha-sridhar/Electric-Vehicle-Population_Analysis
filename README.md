# Electric-Vehicle-Population_Analysis
The dataset is 11.2MB which includes rows= 60.9K and columns= 15. The dataset includes the usage of electric vehicle populations across all the cities in Washington State. In this dataset, I have analysed the descriptive statistics, number of models eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle(CAFV), count of type of model name and number in the counties, count of the same manufacturer but a different model that is mostly used, comparison to verify if the battery range affect the electric range, percentage growth of electric vehicles per county in, growth of units of the model in the market in the Washington state, types of models and numbers with the highest sales, analysis of the electric range of models, deployment of models in selected counties, installation of electric chargers in counties, distribution of the models in respective zip codes.  To visualize the following analysis, I have used various plots to determine the correlation analysis of Electric range vs base MSRP, pair plot for categorical, continuous, and Boolean variables, scatter graph using relation plot(relplot) for numerical variables, distribution plot for electric range, categorical plot for a numerical variable, geographical representation of models county wise, comparison of Electric vehicle type vs CAFV eligibility, comparison of Electric vehicle type vs Electric Range, Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle(PHEV) vs Battery Electric Vehicle(BEV).
